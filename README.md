<p align="center">
We propose **RF-Solver** to solve the rectified flow ODE with less error, thus enhancing both sampling quality and inversion-reconstruction accuracy for rectified-flow-based generative models. Furthermore, we propose **RF-Edit** to leverage the RF-Solver for image and video editing tasks. Our methods achieve impressive performance on various tasks, including text-to-image generation, image/video inversion, and image/video editing.

## News
- [2024.11.08] Code for image editing is released!
- [2024.11.08] Paper released!

## ToDo
- ‚òê Release scripts to for more image editing cases
- ‚òê Release the code for video editing


## Method
### RF-Solver
<p align="center">

We drive the exact fomulation of the solution for Rectified Flow ODE. The non-linear part in this solution is processed by Taylor Expansion. Through higher order expansion, the approximation error in the solution is significantly reduced, thus achieving impressive performance on both text-to-image sampling and image/video inversion.

### RF-Edit

Based on RF-Solver, we further propose the RF-Edit for image and video editing. RF-Edit framework leverages the features from inversion in the denoising process, which enables high-quality editing while preserving the structual information of source image/video. RF-Edit contains two sub-modules, espectively for image editing and video editing.

## Code
### Setup
The environment of our code is the same as FLUX, you can refer to the [official repo](https://github.com/black-forest-labs/flux/tree/main) of FLUX, or running the following command to construct the environment.
```
conda create --name RF-Solver-Edit python=3.10
conda activate RF-Solver-Edit
pip install -e ".[all]"
```
